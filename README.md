## Linerunner (aka Urine Charge)

Lets you run Urinetown lines without needing friends!

Could be expanded to other shows, too, though some things (like character/scene metadata) is hardcoded in places.

To generate your own metadata, use the HTML files in the files/ directory. You should record audio and create a label for each line using Audacity, then export those labels to txt and shove them in the script. The source code for these scripts should be mostly self-explanatory.
